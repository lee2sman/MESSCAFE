<h2 id="why-are-diy-spaces-special">Why are DIY spaces special?</h2>
<p>There's something special about DIY spaces. They create a nexus of activity, sharing, collaboration, art, performance and life as practice unmatched by institutional spaces.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-special-about-virtual-spaces">What is special about virtual spaces?</h2>
<p>For the same reason one might help organize or participate in a DIY space, one can become a member of a virtual community. The definition of a member can vary from forum to forum, online game or chatroom to bulletin board or collaborative wiki. These spaces are organized around a particular topic, tool, space or interest. They create a forum for interaction and conversation (with or without <em>likes</em>), a space to share, and the ability to be This group forms a loose association of thick and thin participation from hardcore Admins and forum mods to 1-off lurkers and the complete spectrum participation in between this range.</p>

<p>Minecraft allows a particular kind of DIY building. In the development of this project I considered finding an already-existing community or virtual space or game, then detourne it, to be adopted and used by an intentional art community. Although I believe such a community may be possible I did not find one exactly like this that is scaleable to a smaller community, allows communication, is horizontally-organized, and permits an open sketch/collage/DIY building collaboration and jamming model.</p>

<p>The above description describes what I am looking for in building a DIY virtual art collaboration community. Such a community does not need to be a scaleable one-size-fits-all space. It can be led and organized by a handful of people, though potentially it may share its work with larger audiences from time to time. It may have rough edgesThe above description describes what I am looking for in building a DIY virtual art collaboration community. Such a community does not need to be a scaleable one-size-fits-all space. It can be led and organized by a handful of people, though potentially it may share its work with larger audiences from time to time. It may have rough edges. It should be open enough for new forms of artwork to be presented. The space should be raw with enough structure to allow it to morph to its participants that activate the space. It may be activated temporarily for select events, existing as more of a showspace for occasional visitors or organizers for meetings. A DIY space exists in a specific and often temporary space in time. They spring up overnight, only to disappear because of rent increases, shut down for illegal use of space, problems with neigbors, problems among members, or a change in member interests, and burn-out, among other reasons. A virtual DIY space may share in many of these potential problems.</p>
<p>So why build such a space? A virtual DIY space serves other potential uses. Some features include: a new space to build anew and the opportunity to try out new things in a virtual sphere and to make new statements, the ability to bring together collaborators across the world who would otherwise be unable to make space together, a space for people who already do digital art to do it together collectively and collaboratively, because it's a radical experiment and there are low stakes for it failing.</p>
