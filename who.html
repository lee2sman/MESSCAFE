Messlife is a collaborative project.

The original idea to build an online virtual artspace came out of a conversation between Lee Tusman and Brandon Avery Joyce. Lee has been involved with spaces such as Little Berlin (Philly), Flux Factory (NYC) and others. Brandon helped found the South Philly Athenaeum and Philadelphia Institute For Advanced Study.
