<p><strong>      Mess.cafe is a virtual DIY artspace in the tradition of warehouse art spaces and alternative venues. Mess.cafe is a free (as in radical) software project, built by many people, for purposes of online and IRL hanging, collab'ing and making. </strong></p>

</p>Messlife is a collaborative project.</p>

<p>The original idea to build an online virtual artspace came out of a conversation between Lee Tusman and Brandon Avery Joyce. Lee has been involved with spaces such as Little Berlin (Philly), Flux Factory (NYC) and others. Brandon helped found the South Philly Athenaeum and Philadelphia Institute For Advanced Study.</p>
